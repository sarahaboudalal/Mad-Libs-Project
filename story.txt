On the wonderful[a] trip to beirut[n], my funny[a] friend and I decided to invent a game. Since this would be a rather boring[a] trip, it would need to be a game with sticks[n] and stones[n]. Using our sticks[n] to fight[v], we tried to get the
kids[n] next to us to play too, but they just stared[v] at us andran[v] away. After few rounds, we thought the game could use some music[n] so we turned on the radio[n] and started dancing[v] to the melodies[n] that came on. This lasted for two hours before I got tired[a] and decided to sleep[v]. I will never forget[v] that trip, it was the coolest[a] road trip of my life[n].
